    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An easy-to-make side dish and a wonderful way to get rid of a few handfuls of home-grown summer herbs. Can also be made with zucchini.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 eggplant, sliced into 1/2-inch rounds</li>
        <li>⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Brush eggplant lightly with olive oil on both sides. Stir together remaining olive oil, garlic, and salt in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Arrange eggplant slices on the preheated grill and cook, turning occasionally, until tender and browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Arrange grilled eggplant on a platter. Brush with olive oil and garlic mixture until eggplant has absorbed oil. Sprinkle with chopped basil and parsley and serve.</li>
    </ol>
